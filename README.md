# Masterthesis-Semantic-Similarity
This is the online repository for my masterthesis. To get more information, read the readme file.

The repository consits of the Matlab code which merges GermaNet and a German Word2Vec output-file into one function which enables you to calculate semantic similarity and semantic relatedness. To get more information about the work, read the masterthesis file provided.
