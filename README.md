# Masterthesis-Semantic-Similarity
This is the online repository for my masterthesis. To get more information, read the readme file.

The repository consits of the Matlab code which merges GermaNet and a German Word2Vec output-file into one function which enables you to calculate semantic similarity and semantic relatedness. To get more information about the work, read the masterthesis file provided.

If you are interested in using the functions, please contact pneiger@bluewin.ch since the human ratings (data) and the file "VektorenUndZuorndung.mat" couldn't be uploaded.

If you are using these functions, please cite the work with:
